# String Handoff Project

This was a project done for Parellel and Distrubuted Algorithms (ICS-440). The general idea is to pass a string between two threads. One thread is a passer (or sender) and on thread is a receiver (or recipient) of the message. A more detailed explination can be found in the StringRendezvousProject PDF.

Please note, that the ONLY code that I provided is in StringHandoffImpl.java file. The rest of the code was given to me by Professor Paul Hyde and Metro State University.
